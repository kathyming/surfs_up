### Findings

* December's low temperature, 56, was 8 degrees lower than June's lowest tempearture of 64.
* June's high temperature, 85, was only 2 degrees higher than December's higest tempperature of 83.
## Summary
Temperatures between June and December on the island of Oahu are very similar with very slight differences.  I would suggest the following two queries to further anlayaze the weather differences between June and December:
* Average precipitation
* Number of days with precipitation (does it rain regularly?)
